## ðŸ”¥ Whats cool in this keyboard:
 - Almost Fully cnc'd aluminium anodized parts for smooth good finish.
 - A fully TPU Gasket mounted keyboard!
 - A 65% keyboard which does have the function keys, numpad but still has the arrow keys!
 - Full neopixels RGB backlighting for extra aesthetics ðŸŒˆ.
 - Fully custom design, no mcu which saves place in the keyboard. it uses and embedded chip and crystal and stuff inside the PCB (USING QMK firmware).
 - Compact and ergonomic. Has a 5 degree tilt for better posture for wrists. Only about 3cm thick on the higher angeled side.
 - USB-C on the side for less wiring.
 - Has a rotatory encoder in it for volume/brightness control.
 - Ig cheap for a premium custom cnc'd keyboard.
